# CVE Information Scraper & Report Generator
**Date:** March 25, 2024  
**Type:** Group project

**Repository:** [github.com/Aveira-jdk/Python_Final_Group_C](https://github.com/Aveira-jdk/Python_Final_Group_C)

## Project Summary
This project is a Python-based CVE intelligence tool.  
You give it a CVE ID, it goes out and collects vulnerability data from public sources, and it generates a professional report in multiple formats.

It pulls data from:
- National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
- Vulmon
- Exploit-DB
- CVE Details

The tool is built to help with fast triage and documentation of vulnerabilities, for research and education.

---

## Features
- **Automated scraping of CVE metadata**  
  - CVSS score, severity, vulnerability description, affected products, references.
- **Exploit harvesting**  
  - Pulls exploit references from Vulmon and Exploit-DB.
- **Multi-format report generation**  
  - Exports to HTML, PDF, DOCX, JSON, and Markdown.
- **"File-options" mode**  
  - Instead of exporting every format, you can choose which formats you want.
- **Validation helper**  
  - Includes logic to check if a given CVE ID exists.

---

## Architecture
- Each data source (NVD, Vulmon, Exploit-DB, CVE Details) is implemented as its own scraper module.
- Each output format (HTML, PDF, DOCX, Markdown, JSON) is implemented as its own exporter module.
- A main controller script orchestrates scraping → normalization → export.

This makes it easy to maintain, extend, or replace modules.

## My Responsibilities
- Implemented the **NVD scraper**:
  - Extracts metadata, description, CVSS, severity, and references.
- Developed the **HTML exporter**:
  - Generates a readable, analyst-friendly HTML report.
- Implemented the **Vulmon exploit scraper**:
  - Pulls exploit info (even if the exploit isn't always actionable).
- Wrote the **main execution logic**:
  - Handles user input, coordinates scraping, builds the combined data structure, and triggers report generation.
- Built the **interactive "file-options" mode**:
  - Lets the user select which output formats to generate on the fly.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- python-docx
- fpdf
- json, re, os, time, webbrowser (standard logic)

---

## Usage Overview
1. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run the main script (`python3 cve_scraper.py`).
3. Enter a CVE ID when prompted.
4. Choose output formats.
5. Reports are generated automatically.

## Why This Matters
- Speeds up vulnerability assessment and reporting.
- Gives repeatable evidence for CVE research.
- Is structured in a way that teaches junior analysts how to move from raw data to documented findings.

This project directly supports structured vulnerability research and educational security analysis.
